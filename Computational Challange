 The Computational challenge was comprised of aligning 300 million DNA sequences (reads) against the human reference genome hg19.
In this case, you needed to align 300 million sequences against the hg19 database. Consider also that an 
alignment of 1000 sequences creates, on average, as output, an ASCII file of 2.7GB.
